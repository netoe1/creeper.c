# creeper.c

Inspired by the first registered virus for computers.

# Intro

For those who doens't know, Creeper was considered as the first computer virus in the world. There's a article by **<i>Kaspersky</i>**, a big and great **<i>tech-security</i>** company, that explains, in a timeline, how this things hapenned. Here is the article:

> As noted by Discovery, the Creeper program, often regarded as the first virus, was created in 1971 by Bob Thomas of BBN. Creeper was actually designed as a security test to see if a self-replicating program was possible. It wasâ€”sort of. With each new hard drive infected, Creeper would try to remove itself from the previous host. Creeper had no malicious intent and only displayed a simple message: "I'M THE CREEPER. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!"

Creeper originally **wasn't** a malicious computer virus, it doesn't make any danger for computers. This example **is** considered a malware, so, careful with you do with this power, because some **wrong step can be a crime**.
