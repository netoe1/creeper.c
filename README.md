# creeper.c

Inspired by the first registered virus for computers.

# Intro

For those who doens't know, Creeper was considered as the first computer virus in the world.
At the first, wasn't a malicious program, just a joke to scary people, but this software that I made, is considered a malware.

# Terms of use

When you run this program and accepted his conditions, you assume the risk with data losses. <strong>I'm not responsible with any damage on any computer.</strong> This is an educational version, I don't allow any bad usage. This is only for fun or education propouses.


# About features

- There's a function called <strong>enableForking()</strong>, it allow the process forking, when a SIGKILL proceed. So, when you kill by terminal, probably the computer has to crash.
- Creeper'll create a lot of files, so you HD will overthink, cure careful.

# Again:

### I'm not responsible for any damages with people, this software was developed for educational propouses.

### I strongly recommend the use with a VM. Oracle VM is the most used. Link above:
